# Topic 
Training large language models (LLMs) at large scale is computationally nontrivial task.
The choice of programming language introduces restrictions, even with using very well optimized libraries (e.g. [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)).
In this thesis, the student will focus on using a pre-trained LLM over knowledge graph to predict missing links.
To this end, the student will closely work on [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c).
Please refer to [Learning continuous representations for Knowledge Graphs](https://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/hs/content/titleinfo/7207119)
for details about knowledge graphs and predicting missing links.
